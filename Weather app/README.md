### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

In order to practise the basics more i used:

- Pure CSS
- Vanilla js
- Open Weather Map Api

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

With this App, i can do the following:

    - I can see a default city weather
    - I can request and see my current location weather
    - I can search for a city (among the list of cities, you can add more dynamically)
    - I can see weather of today and the next 4/5 days (api for more then 96 timestamps is paid xD)
    - I can search for a city in the list or by typing some char
    - I can see the date and location of the weather
    - I can see according to image for each type of weather
    - I can see the min and max degree each day
    - I can see wind status and wind direction
    - I can see humidity percentage
    - I can see a visibility indicator (10km is the max)
    - I can see the air pressure number

## How to improve?

- You can add more cities, in the cities.json file
- The layout can be improved
- Can make a functionality to get the nearest city to your current one if not available
